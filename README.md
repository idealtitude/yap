It's just the very begining of this project... I've managed to write the main pieces of the app which is in a very rudimentary state.

There's many things to do to drive this project to it's goal.

Yet, there's a working minimal yap version; execute yap.py (in the src folder), with a yap file (see test/doc.yp for an example). You can specify an output file with the `-o` option.

```bash
./path/to/yap.py file.yp -o out.html
```

A basic documentation can be found in the doc folder, where you'll learn the yap format (indentation sensitive) and the basics on how to write yap files (the extension is `.yp`) which are just plain text files.
