# YAP

**Yet Another -html pre- Preprocessor**

It's just the very begining of this project... I've managed to write the main pieces of the app which is in a very rudimentary state.

There's many things to do to drive this project to it's goal.

Yet, there's a working minimal yap version; execute yap.py (in the src folder), with a yap file (see test/doc.yap for an example). You can specify an output file with the `-o` option.

```bash
./yap.py file.yap -o out.html
```
